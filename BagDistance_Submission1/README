This submission implements the ChamferDistance+SVM method mentioned in Amores' paper, page 14.
"Multiple Instance Classification: review, taxonomy and comparative study", http://158.109.8.37/files/Amo2013.pdf#Page=14

Step 1: Extract features using ResNet-101 model available at https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch.
This is *not* necessarily the best feature extractor available. 

Step 2: Compute Chamber distance between bags.

Step 3: Convert the distances to a kernel. Train SVM classifier for each attribute (9 in total) separately.

The submission scores are 0.81427 (public LB) and 0.82218 (private LB).
