This submission implements the ChamferDistance+SVM method method in Amores' paper, page 14.
"Multiple Instance Classification: review, taxonomy and comparative study", http://158.109.8.37/files/Amo2013.pdf#Page=14

Step 1: Extract features using ResNet-101 model avaiable at https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch.
This is not necessarily the best model available as a feature extractor. 

Step 2: Compute Chamber distance between bags.
Step 3: Convert the distances to a kernel. Train SVM classifier for each attribute (9 in total) separately.
